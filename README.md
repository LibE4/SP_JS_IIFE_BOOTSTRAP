# Walk-A-Thon Donations

## Description
A donation submission page for a Walk-A-Thon that allows donors to enter their name, email and dollar amount & whether their donation is lump sum or per lap
The donor information stored as JS objects, in a private array in an IIFE, cannot be accessed by the other modules except through an accessor (getter) method.

Used Bootstrap to style the form and table elements. Used Bootstrap's grid system and styling classes to get the following effects.

at desktop size display the table on the left and form on the right with some space around the sides
the page should have the same display on a tablet in landscape mode, but with no space at the sides
on mobile/vertical tablet the table should display above the form
the table entries should be alternately striped

## How to run
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser
